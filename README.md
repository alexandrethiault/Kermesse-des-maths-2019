# Kermesse-des-maths-2019
Mini-games I have coded on the occasion of a maths fair in Lyc√©e Henri Parriat, on 2019

Credit entirely goes to me for the games "Chocolat", "Prisonnier", "Hanoi", "Sorciere". Credit goes to Thierry De Rago for the ideas and original code for the games "Coccinelle" 1 & 2, "Nombre secret", and for the original code of "Triangle", where I only did the debugging and some graphical revamping.
